Package: RedisAPI
Title: Wrapper for 'Redis' 'API'
Version: 0.4.0
Description: Automatically generated 'R6' interface to the full
    'hiredis' 'API'.  Generated functions are faithful to the 'hiredis'
    documentation while attempting to match R's argument semantics.
    Serialisation must be explicitly done by the user, but both binary
    and text-mode serialisation is supported.  This package needs a driver to
    work; the 'redux' and 'rrlite' packages provide appropriate interfaces,
    though neither are yet on CRAN.
